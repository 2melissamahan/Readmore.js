<h2>Readmore.js</h2>

<p>A smooth, responsive jQuery plugin for collapsing and expanding long blocks of text with &#8220;Read more&#8221; and &#8220;Close&#8221; links.</p>

<section id="info">
  <p>The markup Readmore.js requires is so simple, you can probably use it with your existing HTML—there&#8217;s no need for complicated sets of <code>div</code>&#8217;s or hardcoded classes, just call <code>.readmore()</code> on the element containing your block of text and Readmore.js takes care of the rest. Readmore.js plays well in a responsive environment, too.</p>

  <p>Readmore.js is tested with—and supported on—all versions of jQuery greater than 1.9.1. All the &#8220;good&#8221; browsers are supported, as well as IE10+; IE8 &amp; 9 <em>should</em> work, but are not supported and the experience will not be ideal.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js">Fork me on GitHub!</a></p>

  <h3 id="install">Install</h3>

  <p>Install Readmore.js with Bower:</p>

  <div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ bower install readmore</code></pre></div>

  <p>Then include it in your HTML:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<script src="/bower_components/readmore/readmore.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3 id="use">Use</h3>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article').readmore();
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>It&#8217;s that simple. You can change the speed of the animation, the height of the collapsed block, and the open and close elements.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article').readmore({
  speed: 75,
  lessLink: '<a href="#">Read less</a>'
});
{% endhighlight %}

  <h4 id="theoptions">The options:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><code>speed: 100</code> in milliseconds</li>
    <li><code>collapsedHeight: 200</code> in pixels</li>
    <li><code>heightMargin: 16</code> in pixels, avoids collapsing blocks that are only slightly larger than <code>collapsedHeight</code></li>
    <li><code>moreLink: '&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;'</code></li>
    <li><code>lessLink: '&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;'</code></li>
    <li><code>embedCSS: true</code> insert required CSS dynamically, set this to <code>false</code> if you include the necessary CSS in a stylesheet</li>
    <li><code>blockCSS: 'display: block; width: 100%;'</code> sets the styling of the blocks, ignored if <code>embedCSS</code> is <code>false</code></li>
    <li><code>startOpen: false</code> do not immediately truncate, start in the fully opened position</li>
    <li><code>beforeToggle: function() {}</code> called after a more or less link is clicked, but <em>before</em> the block is collapsed or expanded</li>
    <li><code>afterToggle: function() {}</code> called <em>after</em> the block is collapsed or expanded</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the element has a <code>max-height</code> CSS property, Readmore.js will use that value rather than the value of the <code>collapsedHeight</code> option.</p>

  <h4 id="thecallbacks">The callbacks:</h4>

  <p>The callback functions, <code>beforeToggle</code> and <code>afterToggle</code>, both receive the same arguments: <code>trigger</code>, <code>element</code>, and <code>expanded</code>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>trigger</code>: the &#8220;Read more&#8221; or &#8220;Close&#8221; element that was clicked</li>
    <li><code>element</code>: the block that is being collapsed or expanded</li>
    <li><code>expanded</code>: Boolean; <code>true</code> means the block is expanded</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 id="callbackexample">Callback example:</h5>

  <p>Here&#8217;s an example of how you could use the <code>afterToggle</code> callback to scroll back to the top of a block when the &#8220;Close&#8221; link is clicked.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article').readmore({
  afterToggle: function(trigger, element, expanded) {
    if(! expanded) { // The "Close" link was clicked
      $('html, body').animate( { scrollTop: element.offset().top }, {duration: 100 } );
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

  <h4 id="removingreadmore">Removing Readmore:</h4>

  <p>You can remove the Readmore.js functionality like so:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article').readmore('destroy');
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Or, you can be more surgical by specifying a particular element:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article:first').readmore('destroy');
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3 id="togglingblocksprogrammatically">Toggling blocks programmatically:</h3>

  <p>You can toggle a block from code:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article:nth-of-type(3)').readmore('toggle');
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3 id="css">CSS:</h3>

  <p>Readmore.js is designed to use CSS for as much functionality as possible: collapsed height can be set in CSS with the <code>max-height</code> property; &#8220;collapsing&#8221; is achieved by setting <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the containing block and changing the <code>height</code> property; and, finally, the expanding/collapsing animation is done with CSS3 transitions.</p>

  <p>By default, Readmore.js inserts the following CSS, in addition to some transition-related rules:</p>

{% highlight css %}
selector + [data-readmore-toggle], selector[data-readmore] {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <p><em><code>selector</code> would be the element you invoked <code>readmore()</code> on, e.g.: <code>$('selector').readmore()</code></em></p>

  <p>You can override the base rules when you set up Readmore.js like so:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$('article').readmore({blockCSS: 'display: inline-block; width: 50%;'});
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>If you want to include the necessary styling in your site&#8217;s stylesheet, you can disable the dynamic embedding by setting <code>embedCSS</code> to <code>false</code>:</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$(&apos;article&apos;).readmore({embedCSS: false});
{% endhighlight %}

  <h4 id="mediaqueriesandothercsstricks">Media queries and other CSS tricks:</h4>

  <p>If you wanted to set a <code>maxHeight</code> based on lines, you could do so in CSS with something like:</p>

{% highlight css %}
body {
  font: 16px/1.5 sans-serif;
}

/* Show only 4 lines in smaller screens */
article {
  max-height: 6em; /* (4 * 1.5 = 6) */
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Then, with a media query you could change the number of lines shown, like so:</p>

{% highlight css %}
/* Show 8 lines on larger screens */
@media screen and (min-width: 640px) {
  article {
    max-height: 12em;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>

  <p>Pull requests are always welcome, but not all suggested features will get merged. Feel free to contact me if you have an idea for a feature.</p>

  <p>Pull requests should include the minified script and this readme and the demo HTML should be updated with descriptions of your new feature. </p>

  <p>You&#8217;ll need NPM:</p>

  <div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ npm install</code></pre></div>

  <p>Which will install the necessary development dependencies. Then, to build the minified script:</p>

  <div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ gulp compress</code></pre></div>
